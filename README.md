# AllinEmail

- AllinEmail creates a decentralized, secure social network (similar to Twitter, Signal, and WeChat) built on email infrastructure.

- AllinEmail goes beyond being a standard email client for sending and receiving messages. It enables end-to-end encrypted communication through mutual friend connections that exchange encryption keys. This ensures no third party can monitor or alter encrypted messages while effectively blocking spam.

- AllinEmail also supports encrypted group chats, where members communicate using shared encryption keys. Beyond messaging, it integrates features like Twitter-style tweets, WeChat Moments—allowing users to freely share images, videos, or thoughts with followers. As a decentralized platform, it eliminates concerns about third-party censorship, putting full control over content in the hands of users.

- Recognizing traditional email’s slow speed, unreliability, and potential restrictions, AllinEmail includes built-in proxy services. These proxies enable real-time messaging with online contacts without relying on email delivery. All proxy-relayed messages remain encrypted, guaranteeing protection against interception or tampering.
