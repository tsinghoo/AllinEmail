Last Updated: [August 26, 2025]

- AllinEmail is essentially an email client that only communicates with your email server. It does not collect any personal information from users.

- Your messages with friends are transmitted exclusively between your email client, your email server, your friend’s email server, and your friend’s email client under end-to-end encryption. Your personal and your friend’s encryption keys are stored solely on your devices and are never uploaded to any server.

- If you specify a proxy server, AllinEmail will route the encrypted messages through the proxy server to your friend’s email client.
